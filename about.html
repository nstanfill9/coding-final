  <p>About me paragraph
    Hello I am Anna Crockett and the creator of a company called UmaFLor! My team and I have recently created a website so that I could sell products in order to support my music career.
    Our website is beautiful and cohesive with all of the different colors and pictures that go throughout it. 
    <img src="./img/tea.png" alt="tea">
    Some of my products include pins and jewelry. Some fun facts about me are that I love tea, art, and music. You'll be able to see this through this website hopefully. I am a church volleyball 
    coach and a music leader at my church. I hope to be a diplomat one day to fuel my love for traveling and learning different languages. Currently I speak 3.5 languages and am learning two.
    I love to learn but recently I've been to tired to do much.

  </p>
