# Coding-1-Final
 My client for this website is anybody who has the interest in knowing me more. A lot of people do not know me so this is a good way to start. I used minimilistic pieces I found online to design this website. This website is very pretty in my opinioin and the colors are my favorite. The color brown used to be my least favorite color but it is starting to grow on me. Maybe it is not my favorite but I used it in this website because I think it describes me. This website is small but very discriptive of me and my interests.
